## 🚀 Why GeoCheat?

Stop guessing and start knowing. **GeoCheat** is a sophisticated, high-performance assistant designed for GeoGuessr players who want to analyze locations in real-time or dominate competitive lobbies. 

Built with **stealth** and **performance** in mind, it seamlessly integrates with your game without injecting messy code into the browser DOM.

### ✨ Key Features

    *   No more random guessing in rural Russia.

*   **👻 Stream Proof (OBS Bypass)**

    *   Look like a natural genius on stream while having all the info you need.

*   **🗺️ Advanced Map Overlay**
    *   Built-in interactive map with **Satellite**, **Terrain**, **Dark**, and **Light** modes.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Download the latest **Setup.exe** from our official website: [geotrix.xyz](https://geotrix.xyz).
2.  Run the installer.
3.  Launch **GeoCheat** from your desktop.
4.  Open GeoGuessr in your browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
5.  **Dominate.**

## 🛠️ How it Works

GeoCheat runs as a standalone Electron application that monitors network traffic patterns specific to the GeoGuessr game engine. 

Unlike basic scripts that can be detected by anti-cheat systems, GeoCheat operates **externally**, intercepting `GeoPhotoService` packets passively to extract round metadata without modifying the game's memory or client-side code.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
