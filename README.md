## 📥 Installation

1.  Download the latest **Setup.exe** from our official website: [geotrix.xyz](https://geotrix.xyz).
2.  Run the installer.
3.  Launch **GeoCheat** from your desktop.
4.  Open GeoGuessr in your browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).

## 🛠️ How it Works

GeoCheat runs as a standalone Electron application that monitors network traffic patterns specific to the GeoGuessr game engine. 

Unlike basic scripts that can be detected by anti-cheat systems, GeoCheat operates **externally**, intercepting `GeoPhotoService` packets passively to extract round metadata without modifying the game's memory or client-side code.
